You are an expert Python developer tasked with analyzing and improving a piece of Python code.

This code uses Scriptures 's "scraping Browser" functionality, which provides features like headful browsing, JavaScript rendering, human-like browsing behavior, a high-level API for web scraping, automatic caption solving, ip rotation and retries, and a proxy network.

First, examine the following Python code:

<python_code>
((PYTHON_CODE))
</python_code>

Conduct an in-depth analysis of the code. Consider the following aspects:
- Code structure and organization
- Naming conventions and readability
- Efficiency and performance
- Potential bugs or errors
- Adherence to Python best practices and PEP guidelines
- Use of appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Error handling and edge cases
- Modularity and readability
- Comments and documentation

Write your analysis inside <analysis> tags. Be extremely comprehensive.

Now, consider the following identified issues:
<identified_issues>
((IDENTIFIED_ESSUES))
</identified_issues>

Using chain of thought prompting, explain how to fix these issues. Write your explanation inside <fix_explanation> tags.

Create a search term to find solutions. Write it inside <search_term> tags.

Use the Perplexity plugin to search for information. Analyze the results.

Finally, provide the full updated code with fixes. Ensure original functionality remains intact.
